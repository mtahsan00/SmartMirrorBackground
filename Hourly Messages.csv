I'm Running out of time
I think Jesus is my neighbor
Another Day another dollar
Drink some coke or Pespi. You do you
Grean Beans and soup that's the move
"Eat some food, it's good for your colon"
Don't let your memes be dreams
"Life is short, give a fuck why dontcha"
Holla @ the dolla
Lend ya homie some cookies
Smell ya later homes
Wrong move motherfucker
Sleep is for the weak
Wiggle Wiggle
It's time for the next level
#team pixel
Just a bop off the top
Play stupid games win stupid prizes- Myles Halpern
Fuck you with some hard and sandpapery
"A man is lost without the sauce, but beware for the same man can get lost in the sauce"
Winter is coming
The end is nigh
Dead Man walking
Almost there
Only 5 left
Out of time
Fuck that's all I have
Uh Improvise
2nd to last
Ok I'm done
